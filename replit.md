# Stock Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based stock analysis dashboard that provides real-time stock data visualization and analysis. The application fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance and presents it through interactive charts and metrics. The system is built with a modular architecture focusing on data fetching, chart generation, and web-based presentation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a simple three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Streamlit web interface (`app.py`)
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Utility modules for data processing and visualization
3. **Data Layer**: Yahoo Finance API integration for real-time stock data

The architecture emphasizes modularity and separation of concerns, with distinct components for data fetching and chart generation.

## Key Components

### Frontend (Streamlit App)
- **Technology**: Streamlit framework for rapid web app development
- **Features**: Interactive sidebar for stock selection, time period filtering, and real-time data display
- **Configuration**: Wide layout with expanded sidebar for optimal user experience
- **State Management**: Session state management for stock data and current symbol caching

### Data Management
- **StockDataFetcher**: Handles all Yahoo Finance API interactions
  - Fetches comprehensive stock information and historical data
  - Implements basic caching to reduce API calls
  - Provides error handling and data validation
- **ChartGenerator**: Creates interactive visualizations using Plotly
  - Implements dark theme color scheme for professional appearance
  - Provides reusable chart components with consistent styling
  - Supports multiple chart types for comprehensive analysis

### External Integrations
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Primary data source via `yfinance` library
- **Plotly**: Interactive charting and visualization library
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computation

## Data Flow

1. User inputs stock symbol and time period through Streamlit sidebar
2. StockDataFetcher validates input and retrieves data from Yahoo Finance
3. Data is processed and cached in session state
4. ChartGenerator creates visualizations based on fetched data
5. Charts and metrics are displayed in the main Streamlit interface

## External Dependencies

- **yfinance**: Yahoo Finance API wrapper for stock data retrieval
- **streamlit**: Web application framework
- **plotly**: Interactive visualization library
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing support

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for simple deployment scenarios:

- **Local Development**: Direct execution via `streamlit run app.py`
- **Cloud Deployment**: Compatible with Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or similar platforms
- **Containerization**: Can be easily containerized for Docker deployment
- **Requirements**: All dependencies managed through standard Python package management

### Architectural Decisions

**Problem**: Need for real-time stock data visualization
**Solution**: Yahoo Finance API integration with Streamlit frontend
**Rationale**: Yahoo Finance provides reliable, free stock data, while Streamlit enables rapid development of interactive web applications

**Problem**: Maintaining clean, modular code structure
**Solution**: Separation of concerns with dedicated utility modules
**Rationale**: Improves maintainability and testability while enabling code reuse

**Problem**: Creating professional-looking visualizations
**Solution**: Plotly with custom dark theme implementation
**Rationale**: Plotly provides interactive charts with professional appearance, dark theme reduces eye strain during extended use

**Problem**: Managing API rate limits and performance
**Solution**: Basic caching implementation in data fetcher
**Rationale**: Reduces redundant API calls and improves application responsiveness
